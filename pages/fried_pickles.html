    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>For a tasty side dish, try Food Network Kitchen's Almost-Famous Fried Pickles, spiced with cayenne and Cajun seasoning and served with a horseradish sauce.</p>
    <h2>Ingreendients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 Cup All-Purpose Flour</li>
        <li>1 3/4 Teaspoons Italian Seasoning</li>
        <li>1/2 Teaspoon Italian Seasoning</li>
        <li>1/4 Teaspoon Ceyanne Pepper</li> 
        <li>Kosher Salt</li>
        <li>2 Cups Sliced Dill Pickles</li>
        <li>Ranch for dipping</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the sauce: Mix the mayonnaise, horseradish, ketchup and Cajun seasoning in a bowl; set aside.</li>
        <li>Fry the pickles: Heat 1 inch peanut oil in a pot over medium-high heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 375 degrees F. Meanwhile, whisk the flour, Cajun seasoning, Italian seasoning, cayenne pepper, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 cup water in a large bowl until smooth. Spread the pickles on paper towels and pat dry.</li>
        <li>Add half of the pickles to the batter and toss to coat. Remove from the batter using a slotted spoon, letting the excess drip off, and add to the oil one at a time. Fry until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes; remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Return the oil to 375 degrees F and repeat with the remaining pickles and batter. Serve immediately with the prepared sauce.</li>
    </ol>
