    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>TThis is a great recipe that I found in my Grandma's recipe book. Judging from the weathered look of this recipe card, this was a family favorite.</p>
    <h2>Ingreendients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 Cups All-Purpose Flour</li>
        <li>3 1/2 Teaspoons Baking Powder</li>
        <li>1 Teaspoon Salt</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon White Sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/4 Cups Milk</li>
        <li>1 Egg</li>
        <li>3 Tablespoons Butter, melted</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar. Make a well in the center and pour in the milk, egg and melted butter; mix until smooth.</li>
        <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Brown on both sides and serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
